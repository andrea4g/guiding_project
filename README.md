# Guiding Electromagnetic Systems
Using a circuit board dielectric material with 𝜀𝑟 = 4, ℎ = 2 mm, design a microstrip filter according to the specifications in Table 1. In particular:
* Design the prototype filter and apply the required frequency and impedance transformations (consider both a T and π network).
* Design the filter using the stepped-impedance technique with equal electric length transmission line segments (45°). Please allow a segment of input and output microstrip line for the connection to the connectors.
* Simulate the frequency response of the filter.
* Using AWR, print the GERBER file of both the top and the bottom layers of the microstrip circuit.
* Measure the frequency response of the filter (amplitude of S11 and S21).
